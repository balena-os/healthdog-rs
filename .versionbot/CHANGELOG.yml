    - subject: Fix for --pid parsing
      hash: 2f5458fa5c76cda83de690b2e4ef53e141f83427
      body: |
        optflagopt results in the argument for --pid as optional.
        We actually consider the arguement for --pid as required

        Combined with ParsingStyle::StopAtFirstFree, we get an interesting
        situation.

        When healthdog spawns the helper with --pid PID, PID is considered
        to be another argument and not part of --pid somehow.

        As a result healthdog tries to respawn a new process called PID.

        Fixed by making the arguement for --pid as optopt to make the argument
        as required.
